Implement your sort..  you may generate 64 and 128  random numbers for the program to sort or read numbers from a file.  

While you are sorting, you want to count the number of swaps and comparisons you use.  Do this by having a global variable or using the correct type of parameter when you call your sort.

Print the number of comparisons and swaps needed.  Does it look like NlogN?  N^2?  Compute the relevant number for your sort's Big Oh and compare.  Print the expected number and label it as NlogN or N^2.   Do this for both lists.

(These sort programs can be found in many texts and online sources.  Be sure to credit any source you use.)
